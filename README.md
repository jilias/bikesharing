# Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
Overall, the data indicates that the primary targeted audience for the bikesharing services are male subscribers. They tend to use the services for commutes to work between the hours of 6am to 8am and 5pm to 7pm, Mondays through Fridays. While the weekends don't have peaks, they are constant in use.
More visualizaitons of revenue between customers and subscribers would be great to indicate how much money is coming from the services. Data indicates that future marketing can make efforts in advertising to other genders and expand their demographics to tap into potential revenue.
